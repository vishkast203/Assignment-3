Crypto Arbitrage Assignment Files
#The crypto_arbitrage_ipynb file was used to compare the closing values of the Bitstamp & Coinbase Cryptocurrencies across the first quarter of 2018. The maximum arbitrage opportunities were available in January 28, 2018 during the early phases of the Crypto trading. These opportunities became far less frequent in the middle & latter parts of February & March. This is evidenced by the difference in mean return in January ($ 247.55) versus that in the following 2 months ($12 - $15). The drop in arbitrage trading profits was approximately $6.0MM from January to February 2018. 
The data was first read from the csv files provided for bitstamp & coinbase. The data was then cleaned up by removing symbols inherent in the csv files and dropping null values and then checked. Data was converted back to float type to ensure statistical analysis could be performed.
The data was analyzed as slices & overlay plots created to look for differences in closing values over time. Specific trading days were picked to look for clear differences in closng values. Statitical plots such as box plots were created for the analysis. 
The data was further screened for returns greater than 1% after removing returns leass than zero. The statistical data was re-printed using he describe command. The mean return was then used to calculate profit per trade. The cumulative values were then plotted using the cumsum & cumPlot commands
